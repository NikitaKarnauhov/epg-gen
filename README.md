epg-gen
=======

epg-gen is a tool to generate [electronic program
guide](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Program_Guide) in
[XMLTV](http://xmltv.org) format for a given M3U8 playlist. It is intended to
be used by subscribers of Russian IPTV providers who want to supply EPG data
for their chosen media player software (e.g. [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) with [a
suitable IPTV addon](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on:IPTV_Simple_Client)).
Currently scrapers for <https://tv.yandex.ru> and <https://tv.mail.ru> are
implemented (hence mainly Russian-language channels are supported).
